## Q3 data access project for wellington group

### How to run:

Before starting the app for the first time, in VS Code open the terminal run "npm install"

then, in the terminal go to the client directory and use the command "npm start"
in the terminal, go to the server folder and use the command "npm run devStart"

(using a split terminal to see client and server command lines at once helps here.)
